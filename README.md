# RPI Cyber Insecurity

Collection of tools to bypass Duo 2FA / automate logins for RPI services.

Currently contains the following tools:
```
- Duo OTP auto-login extension (chrome)
- Duo OTP auto-login backend server
```

## How to setup
- **Server**: See the `duo_server` folder
- **Chrome extension**: See the `duo_ext_chrome` folder


## Why?
- 2FA is annoying, and having us login every 12 hours doesn't improve security
- Some people don't have working phones, forcing them to go through a lengthy process of getting an OTP code
